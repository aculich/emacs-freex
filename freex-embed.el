(defvar freex-embed-color-step 20
  "This is the global color step size used to determine how
much to increment the color depth based on an overlay's
priority. The default (get-color-from-priority) makes
overlays' red, green and blue values darker by a stepsize of
20 (out of 256).")


(defvar freex-content-storage "files"
  "This determines how the content of your embeddings will
be stored.

If set to 'files' (the default), then freex will write the
contents of embedded overlays out to flat files, as you'd
expect.

If set to 'mirror-files-to-db', then freex
will write the contents of embedded overlays out to files,
but also to a contents field in the database. When reading,
it will read from files. This means you get all the
convenience of flat files, but all the indexing capabilities
of the db. As long as you don't manually edit the database,
things should stay perfectly in sync.

If set to 'db', freex will write the contents of embedded
overlays to the database only, i.e. there will be no flat
files. This requires you to have defined a freex-homepage,
and you will only be able to view your nuggets as embedded
overlays (since there's no way for a database record to
exist as a buffer without being associated with a file. This
hasn't been tested, and probably isn't a good idea.

'mirror-db-to-files - NOT IMPLEMENTED. If you can think of a
really good reason why you'd want this, email us.")
